    > Back-End Code Wrangling

1.1) Refactoring to simplify codebase
1.2) Revisit all client/server messages. Remove redundant, unessissary
     information.
      - Add a login message (client->server) and response so a
        chat/game doesn't need to be started just to log in.
      - Add version numbers to initial communication
      - Log and drop unrecognized messages
1.3) All strings in messages need to be escaped for the separator
     char. (see 1.2)
1.4) Player/admin commands (via chat) will be objects that require
     'help'. Logically they separate by use: chat/game/server. Game
     and chat have an owner, and system has admin(indicated by a flag
     so may be multiple, or different names) some commands are
     restricted to use by owner/admin only. (see 2.4)
1.5) Config files

    > Visible Game Features

2.1) i18n
2.2) Each game will have an 'owner' who started it, /which is cleared
     and changed to the next available player if owner leaves!!!/
     Configurable game rules: game owners can make these changes
     /before/ the game is started (not after I think).
2.3) Configure game via gui and player commands
2.4) Rewrite player/admin commands, via chat window. All commands
     begin with '/' (like irc), followed by single word, and may or
     may not take parameters. As much of the game as possible should
     be controllable via commands.
2.5) Add an admin flag to users in database, so that administration
     can be performed by 'priveledged' individuals.  If there is no
     database, 'debug' is admin. If server started from client (search
     here for "quick host") that user/connection/(what?) is the admin
2.6) Ability to "quick host" a game from the client, by starting a
     server which shuts down when the client shuts down. Adding bots
     should be automatic, or at least trivial
2.7) Hot keys to avoid having to use the mouse: d -> done, r -> roll,
     etc...

    > Even further away

3.1) 5-6 player games
3.2) Cities and Knights
