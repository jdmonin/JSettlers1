 * complete state information, and game logic advances there.
 * Each client's local SOCGame contains only partial state (for instance, other
 * players' resources or devel cards may be of unknown type); and the server directly
 * updates clients' game state by sending messages such as
 * {@link soc.message.SOCGameState} and {@link soc.message.SOCSetPlayedDevCard}.
